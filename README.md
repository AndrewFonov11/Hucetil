# Hucetil

This is a minimalistic (as are all the programs I make) game in C.
And... there are graphics! Yeah, that's rare for me. They're just ASCII characters, though.

## Gameplay

The map is a one-dimensional array. It consists of a player ("$"), a bonus ("%"), and an opponent ("&"). Movement is controlled by the "e" (backward) and "r" (forward) keys. Before starting the game, you can choose whether to enter a random seed (if you choose "y," you must enter the seed afterward).
For more details, I recommend viewing the source code in the "src" folder.

## How did she appear?

On New Year's Eve, I decided to experiment with ASCII art. Inspired by my previous projects (but not borrowing the code from them), I had this miracle ready by January 1st. :)
